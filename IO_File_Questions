When we had these two writers, what is the need of PrintWriter then?
-->PrintWriter is the most enhanced writer. It overcomes the little limitation that we had with FileWriter and BufferedWriter.
eg:: We were allowed to write char and String only with those writers, what if we write to type different type of dataType?
PrintWriter allows us to do so.

-->PrintWriter can communicate directly to file and also can communicate via any other writer.

PrintWriter pw=new PrintWriter("abc.txt");
PrintWriter pw=new PrintWriter(new FileWriter("File.txt"));

PrintWriter pw=new PrintWriter("abc.txt");
pw.write(100); //this will write 100 to file.
pw.println(100); //this will write int 100 and will separate line.
pw.println(true); //this will print boolean true and will separate line.
pw.flush();
pw.close();


Why we use flush() and close() ?
flush() is used to flush all the characters in the buffer and clear the buffer.It flushes the stream so that we can get assured that data
has written to file.
close() method is used to close the character stream and it releases system resources associated with stream.

Note that flush is applicable for all writers and close() is for all readers and writers.


How to read any file?
There are two readers to read file::
FileReader
BufferedReader

Difference between FileReader and BufferedReader?
-->FileReader reads the data from file in the forms of characters..
FileReader fr=new FileReader("abc.txt");
char[] ch=new char[int(f.length())];
fr.read(ch)

for(char ch1:ch)
{
  s.o.p(ch1);
}

With FileReader we read the file character by character,not by line.
For that we have BufferedReader.

BufferedReader allows us to read the file by char and by line too.
