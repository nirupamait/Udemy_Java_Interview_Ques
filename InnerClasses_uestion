What is member inner class?
It is regular inner class of top level class.It acts as the instance member of the outer class.
To access this class, we must create the object of outer class.

member inner class can be public, private, default, protected, 

What is the difference between static nested class and member nested class?
Static nested class is statioc inner class declared inside another class.

class Demo{
  static class Nested{
  s.op
}
}

To create an instance of member inner class, instance of Outer class is required, whereas static nested class does not require any
Outer class instance.

Demo.Nested nest=new Demo.Nested();

In Member Inner class/Non-sstatic nested class, we can access all the static and instance variables of the Outer class.
Where as inside static nested class, we can access only static members of the Outer class.

We can not declare static methods insdie regular inner class, but we can declare static methods inside static inner class.
