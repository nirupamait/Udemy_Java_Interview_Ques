What is NIO?
NonBlocking IO.It provides bettery approach for file handing than standard IO.
It uses channell and buffers.
Introduced in 1.4 and 1.7.

What are the fundamental components of NIO?
-->Channel
-->Buffers
-->Selector
-->Non-blockig IO

Channels and Buffers:: Data is written from buffer to channel and from channel to buffer.
Selectors:: Are used to monitor multiple channels for the events like when data is arrived, and connection is opened.

Non-Blocking IO:: Threads are allowed to go on and do something else in mean time of performing any task.

In which packag the nio classes are present?
-->java.nio.*
java.nio.channel
java.nio.file
java.nio.charset
and many more

What is channel and how many channels are there in java?
-->In NIO, channel is the medium to transfer data efficiently.
It is an interface which provides access to low-level I/O services in a controled way.
Method::
IsOpen:: This tells whether channel is opnen
close::It closes the channel

Channel::
DatagramChannel
SocketChannel
FileChannel
ServerSocket Channel


Which channel is used for reading the data from files?
-->FileChannel. It is used for reading data from files.We can not create its object directly as it is an abstract class.
For object creation- getChannel() method is used

What other channels are used for?
DatagramChannel:: Used to transfer data over network via datagram protocol UDP.
SocketChannel:Can read write data over network using TCP
ServerSocketChannel:Allows user to listen incoming TCP connection.

Note that for every incoming connection socket channel is created.


What are NIO buffers?
NIO Buffers are used to make interaction with NIO channels.
Block of memory into which we can write data and read data from.
In NIO system, this buffer is blocked with NIO Buffer.

How many buffers arte there in java?
InBuffer
CharBuffer
LongBuffer
DoubleBuffer
ShortBuffer
FloatBuffer


ByteBuffer::Most commonly used buffer


How to create ByteBuffer?
To create Bytebuffer, we need to allocate buffer.For that we need to call allocate method.
ByteBuffer b=ByteBuffer.allocate(capacity)

Can we transfer data between channels?
-->Yes, In java NIO we can transfer data directly betwwen channels. Methods present in FileChannel.
FileChannel.transferTo()--Allows data transfer from file channel to some other channel.
FileChannel.transferFrom()--Allows data transfer from other channel to file channel.

What do you understand by Gather write and Scattering reads?
Scattering reads:: is reading the data from a single channel into miultiple buffers
Gathering writes:: is writing data from multiple buffers into single channel.

We have ScatteringByteChannel and GatheringByteChannel for this.

What Selectors are used for?
-->Selectors are used to handle multiple channels using single thread.
Selectors are created as::
Selector selector=selector.open();

--> invoke the register() method on various channel objects to register our interest in various I/O events.

What is the difference between IO and NIO?
IO deals with data in streams whereas NIO deals with data in blocks.
IO is stream oriented and NIO is buffer oriented.

IO streams are blocking and NIO are non-blocking.

What do threads do in the mean time?
-->Threads spend their time in performing IO on some other channels.
-->Im NIO, a single thread can manage multiple channels.NIO have selectors for selecting or registering in different channels.

If you have three sockets, how many thread you will need to handle that?
-->Using NIO we can operate multiple channels using single thread.

What is the byte order of Byte buffer?
-->Byte order is the order in whic multi byte quantity is tored in the memory.There are two types of byte order::
Big-Indian
Little-Indian

Byte buffer has BigEndian as its default byte order.


What is the difference between direct and Non-direct buffer in java?
Non direct buffer is wrapper around byte array and exist inside heap whereas direct buffer resides outside of JVM and memory is not allocated
for it.
