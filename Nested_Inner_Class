What are advantages of nested inner classes?
We use nested class when it is useful to only one class.So, keeping them together helps in packaging of class.
By using Inner class, we develop more readable and maintenable code, becuase it logically groups the classes in one place.
With inner class we can access outer class private variables and at the same time we can access hide inner class from outside world.
It can help in code optimization as it require less code to write.

Can we write nested Interface inside interface?
yes.
When interface is required for one interface only, then we may write Interface inside another interface.
eg:: Entry interface inside Map interface which represents key-value.

Inner interfaces which are declared inside interfaces are always public and static, even if we do not make them public and statioc independently.
Inner interfaces can be implemented independently.
