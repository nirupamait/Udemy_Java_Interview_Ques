Data Hiding:: Technnique to hide internal data objects.
It helps in achieving data security using authentication and private access modifiers.

Abstraction :: Hiding the internal background or implementation and only showing essential things to users is abstraction.

We can achieve abstraction using interfaces and abstract classes. Abstract classes can not be instantiated and can have abstract as well as concrete methods.
Advantage of abstraction is modularity, security and maintenance.

Encapsulation :: Grouping of data members and methods in single unit.Class is capsule or container of data and methods.

Encapsulation= Data hiding+ Abstraction

Inheritance:: It "IS A Relationship". Mechanism to create new class, deriving from base class.
Advantage is reusability of code.

Types:
Single Level
Milti level
Multiple
Hierarchical
Hybrid

Association :: It is "Has A Relationship". Establishing relationship between two different classes using thrie objects.

Two forms of Association::
Aggregation
Composition

An associiation is said to be aggregation if both entities that are associated can exist independently. eg Office has employee
and College has teacher.

Composition ::Stronger form of Association.Two entities are highly dependent on each other.

Diff between Aggregation and Composition is that in aggregation contained object can survive without the container.
