What are OOPS advantages?
1)Simplicity:: Consist of real world objects.
2)Modularity::Each object forms a separate entity.
3.Modifiability::It is easy to change the object's class and methods.
4.Extensibility::Ability to modify the existing behavior by adding new features.

What are different types of Inheritance?
1)Single inheritance:: A class extends another class.

class A{}
class B extends A{}

2)Multileve inheritance::More than one class extends the base class.

class A{}
class B extends A{}
class C extends B{}

3)Multiple Inheritance:: Class extends more than one class.It creates ambiguity when same method is present in both classes.
However, class can implement more than one interface.

4)Hierarchical Inheritance:: It is about having single base class and multiple implementation classes.
class A{}
class B extends A{}
class C extends A{}

5)Hybrid inheriatnce::It is about having multiple base and implementation classes.
Not supported in java.

6)Cyclic inheritance::Class extends itself.Its not required in jva.

What is diamond access problem?
When class extends more than one class, then there is chance of ambiguit which is called diamond access.
