How String is different from Char array?
1.Both of them represents same set of characer, but String represent it as single datatype while Char array represent it as collection of data type.

2.String is immutable but char array is not.

3.String provides various inbuilt function like substring etc but char array dont.

4.String can be stored at any place in memory but char array elements need to be stored contiguously in memory with increasing locations.

5.Strings are stored in String pool, whereas Character array is stored in heap in JVM.


What is String pool?
It is an area in heap memory where String objects are stored.In String pool, there will be no String objects with same content.
It helps in removing redundant String .
eg String abc="John"
   String def="John"

Both will point to same object.

How these statements are different?

What is String interning?
Used to create string in String pool area.

How many objects will be created?
String s1="BasicsStrong";
String s2=new String("BasicsStrong");
String s3="BasicsStrong";
String s2=new String("Basics");

4 objects will be created. 2 inside scp and two heap.

Why String is immutable and final in java?

Which of the following is better to store password String or Char array?
-->String is not recommended because of its immutability.Once created, it is always stored as string pool in memory, unless garbage collector 
earse it.It is a security risk, as anyone having access to memory can find it.
char array can be modified and we can set elements of char array blank or null, once we are done with it.

Difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
String is immutable, so whenever we manipulate String, it creates new and makes older string for garbage collection.
It makes lot os string to get cleaned by garbage.

StringBuffer and StringBuilder are not immutable.
StringBuffer is thread-safe and synchronized whereas StringBuilder is not thread-safe.So, its more faster.
Both has not overrided equals method of Object, so Object's equals gets called.

How to check if the two String are equal?
Using the == and equals method.

The == checks for reference and equals checks for the content

String has overrided the equals method of Object and checks for the content.

What will be output of following code snippet?
String s1="Basics";
StringBuffer s2=new StringBuffer("Basics");
S.o.p(s1.equals(s2));

false because String equals can not compare two different type of object.

How to convert String to charArray and byteArray?
-->To get char array we use, toCharArray.
getBytes is used to get byteArray.

What does substring() do?
